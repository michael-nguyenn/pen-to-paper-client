# Pen To Paper
***Pen To Paper is a simple journalling application where you can create your own entries or save them as templates***

This project was created over a two week period as my capstone project for BrainStation's full-stack development bootcamp. Pen to Paper was made using create-react-app, react-router, and SASS for the front end, a Node/Express backend API with JWT for auth, and Knex to query a MySQL database.
